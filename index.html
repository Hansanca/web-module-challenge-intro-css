    <h1>Yosemite Park Guide</h1>

      <p>Come explore California’s beautiful wilderness.
      Always open. Reservations are not available or required to enter the park.
      <br>
      Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.

      <br>
      First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>
